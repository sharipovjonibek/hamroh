"""The engine — debouncer, queue, inject channel, control loop.

This is the heart of hamroh. The dispatcher calls :meth:`Engine.submit`
for every allowed inbound message. The engine batches them with a 1-second
debounce, formats them as XML message envelopes, and ships them to
the CC worker. While CC is processing a turn, additional messages are
shovelled through the inject channel so they land in the same turn rather
than triggering a new one.

The engine itself owns the asyncio coordination — debounce timer, batch
buffer, processing flag, control loop. It does *not* own the CC worker's
lifecycle (the run loop in ``__main__`` does), nor the database
(persistence happens in the dispatcher before the engine ever sees a
message).
