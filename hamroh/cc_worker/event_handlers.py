"""Stream-json event dispatch for the CC subprocess.

:class:`CcEventHandlerMixin` holds the per-event parsing half of
:class:`hamroh.cc_worker.worker.CcWorker` — relocated verbatim in the
file-size split. It is a mixin (not a standalone object) because the
handlers read and write the worker's turn state: ``_current_turn``,
``_session_id``, ``_result_queue``, ``_stderr_tail``, ``_capture``, and
the tool-error breaker hooks (``_record_tool_error``,
``_cancel_tool_error_watchdog``). Those attributes are defined in
``CcWorker.__init__``.
