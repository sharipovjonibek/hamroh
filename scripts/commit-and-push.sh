# Commit and push all local changes in the server checkout, then it is
# safe to `git pull` and redeploy.
#
# The bot writes its memories straight into the server's git checkout but
# never commits them. Uncommitted changes block `git pull` when the same
# file changed upstream, which breaks deploys. Committing everything first
# keeps the checkout clean:
#
#   ./scripts/commit-and-push.sh && git pull --rebase && docker compose up -d --build
#
# `git add -A` respects .gitignore, so operator config (.env, access.json,
# plugins.json, default-reminders.json, prompts/project.md) and runtime
# data (data/) are never committed — only tracked files like memories/.
#
# When there is something to commit, the script rebases on top of the
# remote (the server may be behind — a deploy is usually triggered by a
# push) and pushes. `[skip ci]` keeps the push from triggering another
# deploy. Safe to run anytime, including via cron.
