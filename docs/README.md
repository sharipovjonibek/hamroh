# docs/

The top-level [README](../README.md) is the high-level intro; everything below is for people (and agents) who need to go deeper.

## Files

### [documentation.md](documentation.md)
The full technical manual for hamroh itself. Read this when you're
modifying, debugging, or auditing the project.

Covers: every env var, the Codex SDK/MCP architecture in detail, how to
add tools and skills, access control internals, memory + reminders,
provider-aware monitoring, the complete security model with all invariants,
the manual end-to-end checklist, and the full repo layout.

### [tools.md](tools.md)
The canonical list of every tool available to the bot — always-on
hamroh MCP tools, Codex web search, and
opt-in groups (subagents, shell, code, Jira, GitLab, GitHub). Also
the canonical reference for [`plugins.json`](../plugins.json): the
schema, how to plug in a new external MCP, how to disable a built-in
tool you don't use, and how to hide a skill. Read this when deciding
what capabilities to grant for your deployment.

### [deployment.md](deployment.md)
Step-by-step guide for deploying hamroh to a VPS (Hetzner,
DigitalOcean, Contabo…) using Docker, plus a continuous-deployment
workflow. Read this when you're moving the bot from your laptop to a
server, or wiring it into CI.
