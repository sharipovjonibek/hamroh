# Plugin config — the example is always shipped; a real ``plugins.json``
# is bundled if the operator has copied it before ``docker build``.
# Anchoring the COPY on plugins.json.example (always present) lets the
# trailing ``plugins.json*`` glob be a no-op when the developer hasn't
# run ``cp plugins.json.example plugins.json`` yet, in both classic and
# BuildKit builders.
COPY plugins.json.example plugins.json* ./

# Access policy — same pattern as plugins. The example is always shipped;
# a real ``access.json`` is overlaid via bind mount at runtime
# (docker-compose.yml) so /allow, /deny, /dmpolicy mutations persist
# across restarts. The image-baked copy (if any) is the seed value.
COPY access.json.example access.json* ./

# Custom reminders — same pattern as plugins/access. The example is always
# shipped; a real ``default-reminders.json`` is overlaid via bind mount at
# runtime and reconciled into the DB at boot. The image-baked copy is the seed.
COPY default-reminders.json.example default-reminders.json* ./

# Data directory (mount as volume). The official Codex Python SDK ships its
